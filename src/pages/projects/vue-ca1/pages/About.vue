        <p>This is the first Ca for the Front-End Development Module of Third year Students of Creative Computing (DL836).
        </p> 
        <br>
        <p>
            The breif for this Ca was to creative a website using using a front-end design development platform Vue.
        </p> 
        <br>
        <p>
            The website has to use an API called "RestCountries" and from this it will connect to the restCountries website and retreive information to power the webpages you are viewing.
        </p>  
        <br>
        <p>
            The Information on the Home page is of a Country Flag, its Name, its Offical Name and Capital. This information is displayed in a card, multiply cards are shown via the power of a for loop</p>
        <br>
        <p>    
             If you click on the Country name <b>(Highlighted Blue)</b> you will be brought to a new section of the webpage where more information of that country will be displayed. This is called the "Indepth page"
        </p> 
        <br>
        <p>
            The Information shown on the "indepth" page is more information taken from the restcountriesAPI. From there you can click on the airport link and from there you will be brought to a new feed and tab that will retreve infromation about all the public Airports in that country. This information is taken from an API called "air-port-codes.com"
        </p> 
        <br>
        <p>
            I hope you enjoy my effort to acheive the breif of this Ca.
